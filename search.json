[{"title":"Writing Literate Configs with Org-mode","description":"Want to write once and generate docs and code? Org-mode can do it - here's how.","tags":["Emacs","Org-mode"],"categories":["Emacs","Org-mode"],"date":"2023-10-13T17:35:03.282Z","body":"Although you can use org-mode for note-taking, as I talked about in , one of the features I have recently come to love about org-mode is the ability to extract source code to a particular file with `org-babel` in Emacs. Simply having the ability to keep my source code and documentation in the same file is incredibly useful, even if I won't necessarily use it all that often.\n\nThe most important part of setting up a literate config file is setting the `header-args` in your org-mode frontmatter. In short, it looks like this:\n\n```\n#+property: header-args{:language} :{option} {value}\n```\n\nThose options can be any number of things mentioned in the [org-mode documentation](https://orgmode.org/org.html#Using-Header-Arguments); however, here is what I like to use:\n  - `:mkdirp yes`\n  - `:tangle no`\n\nNow you might be wondering why I don't set a relevant file to tangle my source code to - after all, that's the point of keeping everything in one document. I wanted to be able to document everything **AND** I wanted to keep my source code all in one document, and if that code isn't getting tangled, then it makes it _just a bit_ harder to use whatever I'm configuring, whether it's Emacs itself, something like Polybar, etc.\n\nThat is because I like to use named blocks for whatever it is I'm configuring. Let's say I'm using Qtile as an example. Instead of simply having this:\n```\n#+begin_src python\nfrom libqtile import layout, bar\n#+end_src python\n```\n\nI can name the block and then reference it elsewhere in the code:\n\n```\n#+name: qtile-ui-imports\n#+begin_src python\nfrom libqtile import layout, bar\n#+end_src\n...\n#+begin_src python\n<<qtile-ui-imports>>\n#+end_src\n```\n\nAnd it makes it much easier to reference throughout the file. Once I have it set up, I can hit `C-c` on the header-args line at the top of the file, and then run `C-c C-v t` and tangle that file and get an updated config file."},{"title":"Why I Left Hugo for Astro","description":"While Hugo is great, I wanted to try some new things out with Astro. Here's what I learned.","tags":["Webdev","Hugo","Astro"],"date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Although I've been a fan of the Hugo static site generator for quite some time now, I've decided to redesign my site and migrate away from Hugo to [Astro](https://astro.build), a relatively new site generator that can handle both server-side rendering and static site generation.\n\nI switched away from it for a couple of reasons:\n- **Easier templating.** Astro uses a JSX-esque templating language for handling dynamic content, while Hugo uses its own Go-based templating language. For an example of Go-based templating, see [this post](/blog/2021/02/featuring-content-in-hugo). The same code in Astro would look something like this (assuming I am using Astro's [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections) API):\n```astro\n---\nconst posts = await getCollection(\"blog\", ({data}) => {\n    return import.meta.env.PROD ? \n    data.featured == true && data.draft !== true\n    : data.featured == true && true;\n});\n// the rest of your code for the component here\n---\n<ul class=\"posts-list\">\n{\n  posts.slice(0, 5).map((post) => (\n    <li class=\"posts-list-item\">\n        <a href=`/blog/${post.slug}` class=\"posts-list-item-title\">\n        {post.data.title}\n        </a>\n        <span class=\"posts-list-item-description\">\n            {post.data.date} // normally just the date, but you can write a function to format it\n        </span>\n    </li>\n  ))  \n}\n</ul>\n```\n\n- **Much better documentation.** Although this might not seem like a huge issue, since there are a variety of blog posts about Hugo, including on this blog, the actual documentation for Hugo leaves much to be desired, in my opinion.\n\n- **Easier Tailwind Integration.**  With Hugo, getting Tailwind integrated was almost a pain in my opinion, requiring you to export a `hugo_stats.json` file which had all the classes in your content in order to get the JIT mode of Tailwind working (see [this post](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/03/making-tailwind-jit-work-hugo-version-3-edition/) for more information). While Hugo v112.0 fixed the issue, having to go through all those extra steps made it a hassle to work with Tailwind in Hugo, whereas with Astro I just have to do `npx astro add tailwind` and follow the prompts and I immediately have access to Tailwind with the JIT mode out of the box.\n\n- **Type-safe Markdown.** With the Content Collections API, I am able to create content with a particular schema, and if the frontmatter doesn't match the schema, then Astro will throw an error (and I am able to define the error message), whereas with Hugo you might have gotten an error, but you'd have to reference whatever code you were using as well as referencing the frontmatter of whatever content you were writing.\n\nHowever, despite my newfound love of Astro, I did find several issues that I had as I converted the site over:\n\n- **No Org-mode support.** Obviously Org-mode was a huge part of what drew me to using Hugo in the first place - while I had started with the native Org-mode parser that Hugo used, I soon swapped to [Ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) in order to do more with Org-mode rather than just Hugo by itself.\n\n- **No taxonomies or RSS out of the box.** While it's important to know how to implement certain things (like taxonomies in this case), having that in Hugo without any additional configuration is much easier than building out functions to simply get each taxonomy set up.\n\n- **No relative links in content.** At least with my setup, I still have to remember the URL if I want to link to a particular post, whereas with Hugo, if I linked to a particular file in my Org-mode document, it would automatically export that link as a `relref` shortcode, which in turn finds the relevant page based on the slug you pass.\n\nOverall, I've really enjoyed working with Astro - I'd highly suggest it as a starting point if you want to learn HTML and CSS - the fundamentals will still apply, but being able to just create templates for content and not having to copy-paste the same code like with normal HTML, along with a simple templating syntax, makes it a great place to start."},{"title":"The Best Tiling Window Managers For Beginners","description":"Tiling window managers have greatly improved my productivity as a dev. Here are a couple I recommend.","tags":["tiling-window-managers","software","twms"],"date":"2021-12-23T15:41:00.000Z","body":"Anyone who knows me knows that I like to use a tiling window manager whenever I can. Having the ability to organize my programs into general categories, combined with the fact that none of the windows were overlapping, makes development so much easier compared to using a floating window manager in my opinion. However, the sheer number of choices presented when I was researching which window manager to use made it incredibly overwhelming for me to figure out where to start.\n\nFor absolute beginners to tiling window managers, I would suggest [Regolith Linux](https:regolith-linux.org), which uses the i3 window manager on top of Ubuntu. I'd also suggest [Qtile](https:docs.qtile.org), for anyone who would rather use a dynamic TWM rather than a manual one like i3. I've also heard that [BSPWM](https://github.com/Baskerville/bspwm) is good for beginners; however, along with basically being a shell script, BSPWM doesn't handle keybindings, instead handing that off to an external program by the same author, [SXHKD](https://github.com/Baskerville/sxhkd), or the Simple X HotKey Daemon. I also don't have that much experience with it, hence why I'm not including as much about it.\n\ni3 is nice (and especially the Regolith config), because it gives you everything you need to get started learning (most) tiling window managers along with a way of checking your keybindings while in the window manager. However, i3 is written in its own language and not a traditional programming language, which means you'll need an extra package or plugin for syntax highlighting in your text editor of choice (whether Vim or Emacs).\n\nI also like Qtile because I don't manually have to set up layouts the way I would with i3, and because it's written in Python, which means that it's easy to configure. It also means it's easy to hack on to, so for instance you could create custom layouts that aren't already available, or custom modules for the bar, etc. My personal favorite features are the ease of configuration, and the layouts feature like I said.\n\nSo if you are interested in trying out a tiling window manager, install Regolith Linux and try out either i3 (which it uses) or install Qtile and try it out."},{"title":"Building A Website From Our Notes","description":"Now that we have our notes and templates set up, let's go ahead and build a site with them as our content.","tags":["Org-roam","Worldbuilding","Wikis","Emacs","Org-mode"],"categories":["Emacs","Programming","Org-mode"],"date":"2021-09-20T21:21:00.000Z","body":"Although the last post in the series assumed you had already set up a hugo site, I wanted to quickly go over setting up a website so that you can quickly get your wiki deployed.\n\nBefore anything, make sure you **BACK UP YOUR NOTES**. This is the most important part of the process, since you will be using those notes later on. I would recommend Nextcloud, since, although some tiers require payment, some are free, and since your files are just plaintext, they are fairly small compared to images, videos, or music files. However, Dropbox also works well for this sort of thing - the choice is up to you. Just make sure you back up your notes.\n\nNow, once you've gotten your notes backed up, you will want to clear the database.\n\n_'But why? Didn't I spend all those time capturing notes with that hydra we made for nothing? What will happen now?'_\n\nGreat question! You've backed up your notes now, so you have a copy you can revert to, if you need to. Open up a scratch buffer (or make an empty elisp file) and then evaluate this code:\n\n```elisp\n(let* ((org-roam-directory \"/path/to/org/docs/\")\n      (org-roam-db-location (concat org-roam-directory \"org-roam.db\")))\n  (org-roam-db-clear-all))\n```\n\nBy now, the let statement should be pretty familiar, since that's the core of our functionality for the hydras. The function `org-roam-db-clear-all` clears all the entries in the database in your org-roam-directory, Since you have your notes backed up, it's not going to be a huge deal to clear the database. Once you've done that, remove your old notes. You want to do this so that you can create a website with your notes.\n\nFinally, the core of actually setting up a website will need you to run this command:\n\n```bash\nhugo new site .\n```\n\nThis command essentially says \"Hey Hugo, I want to make a website in this folder\". Hugo will then create the necessary directories for your site in there. After that, go ahead and create a directory from your hugo base directory called `content-org` (or `org`, or whatever you want to call it, really) - this will allow you to keep your org documents separate from the markdown in the regular `content` directory.[^fn:1] Go ahead and `cd` into `hugo-site-base-directory/content`, because we will need to create 2 small markdown files there, since we don't want them to be a part of our main org-roam notes. One needs to be called `_index.md`, directly in the `content` directory, while one is in a folder called `wiki` (or whatever you want to call it - I just went with wiki). After that, you can go ahead and start recapturing your notes using the hydra we created in the last post, though. However, we want to also add these lines to the top of each org file, since it is metadata that [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) uses to determine things such as the base directory of your site, the section that hugo should put the file into, etc. :\n\n```text\n#+hugo_base_dir: ../\n#+hugo_section: wiki #(or whatever you called it)\n#+hugo_bundle: (whatever the title is)\n#+export_file_name: index.md\n```\n\nWhy would we do this? The first 2 lines are required for ox-hugo to handle exporting your org-mode files to the markdown that hugo uses. The line `#+hugo_bundle` is used to hold the relevant files for a page (such as the main content, and any relevant images, if needed), and the line `export_file_name` is used for exporting the relevant file to `index.md` in the bundle you set.\n\nAfter that, you should go to [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io) and look around for a theme that suits your needs. Later in the series, we will actually be developing our own theme with Tailwind CSS, but for now, just choose a theme you like, and follow its installation instructions.\n\nFinally, just `git commit` your files, and then push them to your repository on Github or Gitlab, or your provider of choice. In the next post, we will be deploying our website with Gitlab Pages and Github Pages, though make sure to read the relevant documentation for your provider of choice.\n\n[^fn:1]: Although Hugo does have arbitrary support for org-mode, some things (such as no multi-word tags, as an example) are unsupported due to the library that hugo uses for parsing org-mode. This is why I use [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) with it."},{"title":"A PSA for my Org-Roam Hydra","description":"A brief announcement about my org-roam hydra, in case anyone actually uses it.","tags":["Emacs","Programming","Org-mode"],"categories":["Emacs","Programming","Org-mode"],"date":"2021-08-24T03:49:00.000Z","body":"As you might have heard by now, [Org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) recently updated to version 2, which allows you to set an ID for a post and a headline, and then link by those IDs.

Although it's a minor change, you wil need to run `org-roam-db-clear` and `org-roam-db-sync` for each directory in your hydra, just to make sure everything is up to date.

Here's my approach.","tags":["Org-roam","Worldbuilding","Wikis","Emacs","Org-mode"],"categories":["Emacs","Programming","Org-mode"],"date":"2021-06-15T02:43:00.000Z","body":"I've recently been playing around with [Org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam), a note-taking package for Emacs and Org-mode based on the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method of taking notes, and interconnecting those notes by means of backlinks, and one place this style of note-taking is very common on is the [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) website. In the little bit of time that I've gotten to try this line of research, I've found it much more helpful with regards to actually remembering things rather than my old method of just writing it down in a notebook - having backlinks where I can go back and reference any information I've gotten is very helpful. Despite my love of this way of keeping myself organized, I wanted to be able to quickly capture ideas for any worldbuilding ideas I had - something which I feel like would fall into one of the worldbuilding wikis I maintain for myself, rather than the notes I use by default (for things such as software or any books I've read). I wanted to try and do more with Emacs-lisp, and so I found that trying to write a hydra for it might be a good place to start. Although I had found that the idea in the documentation of creating a `.dir-locals.el` in the directory where I needed a roam database was a good place to start, I found that it ultimately forced me to have to be in that directory to capture an idea if I suddenly came up with one, which I feel like sort of goes against the entire workflow I have set up at this point. I knew that I needed to do three things with my \"Roam hydra\":\n\n-   quickly capture ideas for my worldbuilding projects.\n-   insert links to those files in any other wiki files, if I had to.\n-   quickly find files for the wiki, if I needed to update them.\n\nAnd so, I decided to set up my first hydra for finding files. I figured I didn't want to set one up where I could add a file, but finding a file seemed like a good place to start.\n\n\n## The Base Hydra - Finding Files {#the-base-hydra-finding-files}\n\nI figured fairly early on that once I had one function and hydra down, I would effectively have all three down, but I would just need to update the function I needed to call (such as `org-roam-node-find` or `org-roam-capture`). I started by looking over the code from the excellent blog post on [refiling Org-mode items with a hydra](https://mollermara.com/blog/Fast-refiling-in-org-mode-with-hydras/). Spoilers - I'm not very good at Elisp, so when I saw his macro with all the backticks and commas, I found it fairly hard to follow along, at least until I found a cheatsheet for elisp earlier today. I first overwrote the function with a simple `(let*)` before I called `org-roam-find-file` and ran it in a simple scratch buffer. I was using the wiki I have for my alt-history setting [Broken Thrones](https://brokenthrones.jhilker.com) as an example, since that has become one of my main passion projects in my off-time, but feel free to use any hugo-site with [Ox-Hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) set up as an example. I am using a directory called `content-org` in that hugo site, but use whatever you want.\n\n```emacs-lisp\n(defun jh/find-org-roam-file (directory)\n  \"Sets the org-roam directory and database and finds file.\"\n  (let* ((org-roam-directory (concat directory \"content-org/\"))\n         (org-roam-db-location (concat directory \"org-roam.db\")))\n    (org-roam-node-find)))\n```\n\nAfter evaluating that in a scratch buffer, now I knew that I had enough for a basic hydra. Here is my final configuration for this base hydra after I did some UI tweaks for the help menu, but if anything the UI isn't as important as functionality, at least when first setting it up.\n\n```emacs-lisp\n(defhydra jh/find-org-roam-file-hydra (:hint nil :exit t)\n  \"\n^Default^            ^Conworlds^             ^Campaigns^\n^^^^^^^^------------------------------------------------------------\n_d_: Default         _b_: Broken Thrones     _e_: Ere Break of Day\n_q_: Quit            _s_: Shattered Skies    ^ ^\n\"\n\n  (\"d\" (jh/find-org-roam-file \"~/org/roam/\"))\n  (\"b\" (jh/find-org-roam-file \"~/Projects/conworlds/brokenThrones/\"))\n  (\"s\" (jh/find-org-roam-file \"~/Projects/conworlds/shatteredSkies/\"))\n  (\"e\" (jh/find-org-roam-file \"~/Projects/campaigns/mirkwoodCampaign/\"))\n  (\"q\" nil))\n```\n\nOnce I had that, I knew I could just replace `org-roam-find-file` with `org-roam-capture` or whatever I needed to call. Although I am reusing a lot of code for this, in time I will try to clean it up. If you need the other hydras I use on a daily basis for roam notes, here they are.\n\nTo actually use the hydra, bind `jh/find-org-roam-file-hydra/body` to a keybinding (I use `SPC n r f`) in my configs for both vanilla Emacs and Doom Emacs, and you should be set.\n\n\n## Capturing Hydra {#capturing-hydra}\n\n```emacs-lisp\n(defun jh/org-roam-capture (directory)\n  \"Sets the org-roam directory and database and captures to file.\"\n  (let* ((org-roam-directory (concat directory \"content-org/\"))\n         (org-roam-db-location (concat directory \"org-roam.db\")))\n    (org-roam-capture)))\n\n(defhydra jh/org-roam-capture-hydra (:hint nil :exit t)\n  \"\n^Default^            ^Conworlds^             ^Campaigns^\n^^^^^^^^------------------------------------------------------------\n_d_: Default         _b_: Broken Thrones     _e_: Ere Break of Day\n_q_: Quit            _s_: Shattered Skies    ^ ^\n\"\n\n  (\"d\" (jh/org-roam-capture \"~/org/roam/\"))\n  (\"b\" (jh/org-roam-capture \"~/Projects/conworlds/brokenThrones/\"))\n  (\"s\" (jh/org-roam-capture \"~/Projects/conworlds/shatteredSkies/\"))\n  (\"e\" (jh/org-roam-capture \"~/Projects/campaigns/mirkwoodCampaign/\"))\n  (\"q\" nil))\n```\n\n\n## Insertion Hydra {#insertion-hydra}\n\n```emacs-lisp\n(defun jh/org-roam-insert (directory)\n  \"Sets the org-roam directory and database and inserts link to file.\"\n  (let* ((org-roam-directory (concat directory \"content-org/\"))\n         (org-roam-db-location (concat directory \"org-roam.db\")))\n    (org-roam-node-insert)))\n\n(defhydra jh/org-roam-insert-hydra (:hint nil :exit t)\n  \"\n^Default^            ^Conworlds^             ^Campaigns^\n^^^^^^^^------------------------------------------------------------\n_d_: Default         _b_: Broken Thrones     _e_: Ere Break of Day\n_q_: Quit            _s_: Shattered Skies    ^ ^\n\"\n\n  (\"d\" (jh/org-roam-insert \"~/org/roam/\"))\n  (\"b\" (jh/org-roam-insert \"~/Projects/conworlds/brokenThrones/\"))\n  (\"s\" (jh/org-roam-insert \"~/Projects/conworlds/shatteredSkies/\"))\n  (\"e\" (jh/org-roam-insert \"~/Projects/campaigns/mirkwoodCampaign/\"))\n  (\"q\" nil))\n```"},{"title":"My Org-Mode Workflow","description":"I currently use org-mode for a lot of things. This is how I use it.","date":"2021-06-13T00:46:00.000Z","body":"Although I briefly describe my workflows in the [notes section](https://braindump.jhilker.com) of my website, I wanted to go far more in-depth here on my blog vs. in the notes file. I think of it this way - a note is a quick reminder of something, while something like an article or post is more in-depth.\n\nI use org-mode for most of my stuff now - if I am writing a README as an example (or writing generally), I'll use org-mode where I can, including in emails. In addition, I'll use it for my actually organizing my day or week, although I am using Google Calendar just for better integration with my phone. (I'm still working on my orgzly configuration). I am keeping my primary org-mode files in Dropbox so that I can sync them to any device.\n\nThe best feature of all this is my extensive use of capturing ideas, tasks, and events with `org-capture`. This way, I can still heavily focus on the current task I'm working on, while still getting ideas down if I need them.\n\n## My Agenda Workflow\n\nOne of the nicest features of org-mode is the ability to create custom agenda commands for different views. And in these views, you can have different files for different sections of an agenda, or for each individual agenda view. I currently have a few org-mode files in my dropbox that I use as agenda files.\n\n| Filename        | Purpose                                                    |\n| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `inbox.org`     | Where any ideas I have come in.                            |\n| `orgzly.org`    | Same as `inbox.org`, but for any ideas I have on my phone. |\n| `todo.org`      | Keeping track of general todo items.                       |\n| `gcal.org`      | My personal calendar events.                               |\n| `projects.org`  | Where I manage small to medium size personal projects.     |\n| `work.org`      | My work-related todo list.                                 |\n| `work-gcal.org` | My work-related calendar.                                  |\n\nAs an example, I currently have a custom agenda view that I call a dashboard - although I don't include any projects in it, I give my projects their own dashboard since some of them can get quite big for a solo project. Excuse the windows laptop, my Linux machine is currently being repaired.\n\n![](./img/org-mode-workflow-dashboard.png)\n\nThis is my \"daily dashboard\" view - everything at the top is everything with a date for today. Underneath that, I have a list of the inbox items I need to review. Underneath that, I have anything I need to follow up or read from my email, and lastly, I have a list of general todo items. Although GTD normally has you set deadlines for every little item, I feel like if I set an arbitrary deadline for something where it wouldn't be necessary, it's much easier for me to ignore that deadline, which in turn makes it easier for me to ignore all my deadlines. I'd rather something take longer and eventually get finished, rather than me forcing arbitrary dates on myself and eventually ignoring that date.\n\n## For Tasks\n\nAs far as actually organizing myself, my workflow is a mix of both Getting Things Done, the Pomodoro method, and my own thing, although I use both GTD and Pomodoro for slightly different reasons. I used to be more of a \"just get it done, don't worry about logging it\" sort of person, but now I feel like it's a lot easier for me to just record a task or an idea if something comes up.\n\n1.  Capture a task using `org-capture` and save it to the inbox.\n2.  Continue working for the duration of the currently running timer.\n3.  During a break, quickly glance over the inbox.\n4.  At the end of the day, review the inbox, and refile with a [hydra](https://mollermara.com/blog/Fast-refiling-in-org-mode-with-hydras/) as appropriate.\n\nI mostly use it like this because I have had trouble focusing in the past, and now I can quickly get an idea into my head and into a file so that I can get back to work and review it later. Other than that, I'll set a pomodoro timer, clock in the task, and get to work.\n\n## For Note-Taking\n\nThis, along with the task management system I described above, is what makes classes easier, although I'm disappointed that I didn't implement org-mode sooner until now. I am currently using [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/) to get a similar setup to what I had in [Notion](https://notion.so/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) so that I can connect notes to past information I've learned. Although this is still currently in progress (mainly trying to figure out campaign notes with a similar system to what I have for my primary note-taking system), I will update this when I get something working.\n\n## For Writing\n\nOrg-mode, in addition to being an excellent productivity tool, is also a very nice markup language. This means that it's not too difficult to write something in org-mode, and export to something like a Word document or a PDF with \\\\(\\LaTeX\\\\) or Groff if you need a manuscript.\n\n### For The Blog\n\nI have a few capture templates set up for various things on my site - namely, a blog post and a potential project. I am currently using [Ox-Hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) for publishing my org-mode files to the relevant Hugo Markdown files in the correct directory. Inside my website folder for org-files, I have two separate files for handling different parts of my site.\n\n| Filename       | Purpose                       |\n| -------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| `blog.org`     | For any completed blog posts. |\n| `projects.org` | For my portfolio.             |\n\nOverall, my workflow looks a little something like this.\n\n1.  Capture an idea for a blog post, and save that to `blog.org` in my dropbox.\n2.  Add a TODO item to my todo list to finish that post.\n3.  Finish writing the blog post, and refile with a hydra as appropriate.\n4.  Publish the post with `org-export`.\n5.  Commit the changes, and push to my gitlab.\n\n## For Outlining Longer Works\n\nAlthough I am not a very good writer, I do enjoy worldbuilding and writing campaign ideas. This is still very much in progress, but the idea is to capture an idea to a file called `writing.org` in my Dropbox which acts as a sort of inbox for any writing ideas I have. It's not perfect at all, but I am still figuring out the right workflow to have for this sort of thing. It acts fairly similarly to the way my task system does, where I review it at the end of the week and apply it to any relevant worldbuilding or writing projects I'm working on. I might try something with capturing into the current buffer I'm in, but I'm not entirely sure, though."},{"title":"Using a Makefile with My Website","description":"How I (ab)used a Makefile to improve my Hugo developer experience.","tags":[],"date":"2021-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","body":"It shouldn't be a surprise that I use Hugo as a static site generator. Not only is it fast, but it is also incredibly customizable, which is something that I find useful considering my website has so much stuff on it. In addition, being able to create shortcodes to avoid reusing code on certain pages is such a helpful tool for wikis. Finally, having support for Emacs' [Org-Mode](https://orgmode.org/) is what initially drew me to Hugo in the first place. I had tried using org-publish to try and set up a website, but had so many little issues with it that I decided to scrap it and keep looking around for a better way to set up a website. That was when I found Hugo, and decided to try it out.\n\nUltimately, I found that when I was starting to create layouts and templates, typing the full `hugo server -D --navigateToChanged` was just long to type (yes, lazy, I know), especially when I was debugging an error with my shortcodes and templates. Being able just to type `make server` makes it much faster for me to debug code but also to get previews of code.\n\n## Not Just For Debugging\n\nHugo also allows for content to be created with a certain [archetype](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) - by default, this matches the directory you are creating the content for. As an example, if I had an archetype called `project.org`, if I ran `hugo new project/hello-world.org` the file `content/project/hello-world.org` would be created, with all the content needed for a blog post. Here's what my org-mode project archetype looks like:\n\n```org\n#+title: {{ replace .Name \"-\" \" \" | title }}\n#+draft: true\n#+srclang:\n#+srcicon:\n#+summary:\n#+type: project\n#+featured:\n#+layout: single\n#+percDone: 0\n#+lastUpdated:\n#+docs:\n#+projectSite:\n#+gitlab:\n#+github:\n#+bitbucket:\n#+readmore: false\n```\n\nObviously that's a lot of custom parameters, so I'll try to go through line-by-line and explain what's going on.\n\nThe `title`, `draft`, `layout`, `type`, and `featured` parameters are all easy enough to understand, I feel like. The `srclang` represents the language or languages the project is written in - for my pyronsworn project, as an example, it's written in python. The `srcicon` is the icon to use to display next to the source language - it must be one of the languages or icons listed at [devicon.dev](https://devicon.dev/). The `percDone` is used to fill the progress bar across from the source language - it represents how much is approximately done on the latest release of the project. The last 4 parameters are all different links to places where the project lives - additionally, you can set up a trello link, add a trello parameter to the project frontmatter, and you can see the link to the roadmap, though that isn't required. The `readmore` variable is used to provide a way to read a little bit more about the project before trying out the project.\n\nWhile setting up a snippet could be useful for this, Hugo has the tools to do it automatically. However, the one thing I hadn't had much luck with was using the `read` command in a Makefile. Ultimately, I figured out the answer through an answer on [the Unix StackExchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/322517/read-command-not-working-in-a-makefile) which ultimately allowed me to read in user input when I ran a `Make` command. So now, instead of having to run `hugo new projects/some-project.org -k project`, I can just run `make project` and immediately get the template set up. While not a perfect setup, it's much easier to get going rather than using the full command or even creating an empty file in the right directory. And while I could set up different file formats in the Makefile, such as `post.org`, I feel like getting the initial functionality down is much more important than bonus features.\n\nHere is my current Makefile for the website.\n\n```makefile\n.PHONY: server post project\n\nserver:\n@hugo server -D --navigateToChanged --verbose\n\npost:\n@echo \"Enter the file name (include the suffix): \" && read filename; hugo new blog/$$filename -k post\n\nproject:\n@echo \"Enter the file name (include the suffix): \" && read filename; hugo new projects/$$filename -k project\n```"},{"title":"Featuring Site Content in Hugo","description":"How I implemented \"pinned\" content in Hugo for my site.","tags":[],"date":"2021-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","body":"I recently found that the layout for my index page here was cluttered - I had content both in the org-mode file where I would write a post, as well as in the `index.html` file that actually rendered content to the page. I knew I wanted to have a shortcode so that I could more easily use that content again, if I needed to. However, I also knew that I'd want to have a list of both featured posts that I thought were my best work, as well as a list of recent posts on the page. I first used part of the list layout from the theme I'm using here, and created a shortcode for only getting posts from my personal blog, and limiting it to the 5 most recent posts.\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"posts-list\">\n  {{ range first 5 (where .Site.RegularPages \"Section\" \"blog\").ByDate.Reverse }}\n  <li class=\"posts-list-item\">\n    <a class=\"posts-list-item-title\" href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a>\n    <span class=\"posts-list-item-description\">\n      {{ .Date.Format \"02 Jan.\" }}\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  {{ end }}\n</ul>\n```\n\nOnce I had created that simple list, I decided it might be nice to have a short list of all the posts I'd want to feature on my index page, sort of as a showcase. I kept trying lots of different ideas, but ultimately found this code to be the simplest and easiest.[^fn:1]\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"posts-list\">\n  {{range first 5 (where (where .Site.RegularPages \"Type\" \"post\")\n  \".Params.featured\" \"==\" \"true\") }}\n  <li class=\"posts-list-item\">\n    <a class=\"posts-list-item-title\" href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a>\n    <span class=\"posts-list-item-description\">\n      {{ .Date.Format \"02 Jan.\" }}\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  {{ end }}\n</ul>\n```\n\nHowever, once I had tested both the featured and recents code on the index page, certain posts would show up in both. I had tried to find some tiny bit of code that could work for both, but then I found the dumbest mistake I had made.\n\nI had forgotten to filter my recent posts list.\n\nOverall I had to nest one more `where` clause into my recent posts shortcode. While I can't set a direct number of posts to show right now, I'm going to keep adding to it to ensure I can do that, if I wanted to. This was the final bit of code I had, and what I currently use.\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"posts-list\">\n  {{ range first 5 (where (where .Site.RegularPages \"Section\" \"blog\")\n  \".Params.featured\" \"!=\" \"true\").ByDate.Reverse}}\n  <li class=\"posts-list-item\">\n    <a class=\"posts-list-item-title\" href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a>\n    <span class=\"posts-list-item-description\">\n      {{ .Date.Format \"02 Jan.\" }}\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  {{ end }}\n</ul>\n```\n\n[^fn:1]: Although this does also include my Digital Studies blog, I will most likely be archiving those posts at the end of the semester - I'll still have access to them, but at the same time, if I had made a post for that class I was proud of, I could move it to my blog directory without much of an issue."}]
