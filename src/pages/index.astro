          Hi! I'm Jacob, a former student of the University of Mary Washington.
          I graduated with a major in Computer Science with a minor in
          cybersecurity. Although I majored in cybersecurity, I found that it
          really wasn't what I was looking for - my original plan was to minor
          in political science, but the closest thing the university had was
          International Relations, which wasn't exactly what I was looking for -
          this was also around the time the <a

            >Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal</a
          >
           was coming to light, and so I figured that cybersecurity was going to
          become very quickly involved with political science.
