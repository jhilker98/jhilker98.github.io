Although I've been a fan of the Hugo static site generator for quite some time now, I've decided to redesign my site and migrate away from Hugo to [Astro](https://astro.build), a relatively new site generator that can handle both server-side rendering and static site generation.

I switched away from it for a couple of reasons:
- Easier templating. Astro uses a JSX-esque templating language for handling dynamic content, while Hugo uses its own Go-based templating language.
- Much better documentation.
