I've always been a fan of the Bungie game Destiny - I started playing back when [The Dark Below](https://www.destinypedia.com/The_Dark_Below) launched, and since then have been a fan of the series. However, I wanted an easier way to continue to view the weekly updates, or "weeklies", in Destiny 2. This site aims to provide the latest weekly updates in the game, as well as links to the latest blog post. While currently being planned, stay tuned here for updates.

This project is not affiliated with Bungie in any way, I'm just a fan of the games.
