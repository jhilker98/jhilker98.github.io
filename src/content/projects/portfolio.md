Despite originally building my site with Hugo, I wanted to redesign it and try out a new tech stack with Astro and TypeScript. I had heard many positive things about Astro, and so in June of 2023 I began redesigning the site and converting my Hugo layouts and partials over to Astro components. While not the fanciest by any means, I wanted to make sure the site was both accessible and fast, and I had heard excellent things about the speed of Astro. It overall felt much easier creating the project with Astro compared to Hugo - no need to work with Git submodules or Go templating language.
