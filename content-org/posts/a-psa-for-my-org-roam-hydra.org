As you might have heard by now, [[github:org-roam/org-roam][Org-roam]] recently updated to version 2, which allows you to set an ID for a post and a headline, and then link by those IDs. However, several functions were renamed to be more consistnt with the rst of the org-roam. This is a PSA to anyone using that you will need to edit those functions slighly for functionality. In =jh/find-org-roam-file=, you will need to replace =org-roam-find-file= with =org-roam-node-find=, and in =jh/org-roam-insert=, replace =org-roam-insert= with =org-roam-node-insert=. Although it's a minor change, you wil need to run =org-roam-db-clear= and =org-roam-db-sync= for each directory in your hydra, just to make sure everything is up to date. While not ideal, I wanted to make sure it would work.
