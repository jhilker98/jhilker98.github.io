Hello! I'm Jacob, a former student of the University of Mary Washington. I graduated with a major in Computer Science with a minor in cybersecurity.  Although I majored in cybersecurity, I found that it really wasn't what I was looking for - my original plan was to minor in political science, but the closest thing the university had was International Relations, which wasn't exactly what I was looking for - this was also around the time the [Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) was coming to light, and so I figured that cybersecurity was going to become very quickly involved with political science.

Beyond software, I have a deep love of games, both tabletop and video games. If you had to ask me what my favorite video game is, I would have to say Super Metroid, from the SNES. I feel like a lot of it boils down to the individual elements, rather than the game as a whole.

I also enjoy worldbuilding. My two most recent projects are [Broken Thrones](https://brokenthrones.jhilker.com), an alt-history/low fantasy setting, and [Shattered Skies](https://shatteredskies.jhilker.com/), a Metroid-meets-Halo-meets-Destiny, gritty sci-fi setting.

Outside of games and worldbuilding, I also develop themes for the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I'm currently working on two at the moment - [All For One](https://github.com/jhilker1/hugo-all-for-one), an all-in-one blog, portfolio, and CV theme, as well as a variant of it for wikis, which I am calling [Halfmoon Wiki](https://github.com/jhilker1/hugo-halfmoon-wiki) until I can come up with a better name for it.
